Many developers, solopreneurs, and small teams have heard of and even come across status pages out in the wild.
How many of you have one for your own project or business?
My take? Not enough and this is a mistake.


## What is a Status Page?

Before I go into why status pages are important, it would be wise to cover what they are.
In the world of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) status pages are a way to communicate the health of your services.
They show when services are up and running, but more importantly, when they are down.
Here's an example of a healthy status page for the deep link validator [yURL](https://yurl.chayev.com/).

## Why are they important?

The obvious answer is that they let people know when your services are down.
There's a bit more to it though.

### Separate infrastructure means reliability

Communicating to users during an outage can be difficult.
If your product is down, it's likely your communication tools are too.
Status pages tend to be hosted on separate infrastructure from yours giving you a reliable tool to use during an outage.
Communication is key.

### Multichannel communication

Speaking of communication, status pages allow effective communication via multiple channels.
JSON, RSS, and Atom feeds, email, text message, Slack, and more are ways many status pages allow customers to stay informed.
This allows them to get notified of outages via the way that is most convenient for them.
Convenience means well informed users.

### Help Support, reduce tickets

Informed users open less support tickets, are less likely to blast you on social media, and less likely to chat in that little chat pop up at the bottom of your website.
For larger companies, this means money saved.
For smaller teams, this means people focused on recovering from the outage rather than splitting time across all of these tools.

Lastly,

### Showing off

Do your services have great uptime?
A status page that shows great uptime instills trust.
It becomes a track record that backs up any claims of reliability your marketing pages might offer.
